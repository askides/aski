Personal suite of tools for creating beautiful web apps âœ¨

## What's Inside?

This repo aim to be a collection of tools from components to utilities to help you build web apps effortlessly. Currently the monorepo contains two projects:

- [Elements](./libs/elements/README.md): A collection of React UI components to build web apps.
- [CLI](./packages/cli/README.md): A CLI tool to add elements to your apps effortlessly.

## Can I See A Demo?

Sure! You can check the [Storybook](https://elements.askides.com/) to see all the components in action.

## Motivation

I love the idea behind what Shadcn's UI gives to the end user, and I wanted to create something similar to be used for all my projects as a learning experience. Obviously, this is not a copy-paste of Shadcn's UI, but it's inspired by it.

## How To Get Started?

Have a look at the [Elements](./libs/elements/README.md) and [CLI](./packages/cli/README.md) documentation to get started.
