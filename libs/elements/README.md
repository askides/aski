# Elements

A collection of UI components to build web apps.

## Disclaimer

Elements aim to be an easy-to-use collection of UI components for building web apps.

The idea behind Elements is to provide a set of components that are easy to use and customize. The components should be simple to understand and use, and should be easy to style and extend.

This package is currently a work in progress. The API is possibly subject to change. Use at your own risk.
