# Elements

Elements aim to be an easy-to-use collection of UI components for building web apps.

The idea behind Elements is to provide a set of components that are easy to use and customize. The components should be simple to understand and use, and should be easy to style and extend.

## Disclaimer

This package is an `always-work-in-progress`, as it's used for my personal projects, so it will be improved and updated from time to time.

## Components Demo

There's a demo available for the components in the Storybook, which you can run locally, or access online at [https://elements.askides.com](https://elements.askides.com).

## Installation and Usage

To install Elements, there are two options available.

### Option 1: Source Code

This option is recommended if you want to keep the full flexibility for your components or if you want to use them in a project that doesn't use npm.

1. Install the package from npm:

```bash
npm install @askides/elements
```

2. Copy the source code to your project.

You can find all the source code in the `libs/elements` folder. Copy the components you need to your project.
